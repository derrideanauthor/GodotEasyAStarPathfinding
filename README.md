# GodotEasyAStarPathfinding
Alternative A* pathfinding class for Godot 

Godot does have AStar pathfinding but the process is tedious for my purposes. This class has been rewritten to gdscript. Original author and source is at the top in AStar_memtronic.gd. If you have similar issues with Godot's pathfinding node, give this a try.
